# Carpool
/// In progress ///

Its a mobile app developed using Swift with Xcode. This app allows users that are hosting an event to get a unique code that's sharable with the guests. When a guest uses this code in the application, he choose wether he wants to offer a ride or ask for one. In the case of givin a ride, the guest can choose a range of meters around his path to the event in which he would be able to give a ride to some other guest that also used the event code in the application and needs one.
